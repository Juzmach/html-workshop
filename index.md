# Introduction

Welcome to the HTML Workshop material site. This site is made specifically for the workshop held in May 2015 for Aalto university's economics students, but the material is free for everyone to use. The materials are aimed for people who have no prior experience in HTML, CSS, JavaScript or website development in general. 

Web development is a huge subject nowadays. In fact it is so huge that there is an entire world built around it. And it's growing constantly, as businesses and services are migrating to web. Because of this, we can't possibly go over everything there is to web development in our limited time. What we are going over in this workshop are the very basic topics that build the very foundation of today's web.

The goal of this workshop is to get you off to a good start on learning web development.

# Setting up the environment

Let's go shortly over the basic tools we're using.

## Tools we're using

Creating websites do not require any fancy equipment. You only need a text editor and a browser! Most web developers have started their journey writing everything in Windows Notepad.

However, today there are a plethora of different editors and IDEs (Integrated Development Environments) that one can use, everyone of them has their own merits and downsides.

For our workshop, the choice of tools is limited by our location. I've found two editors that are suitable:

### Notepad (or Gedit / TextEdit)

The obvious one that is found on any Windows machine. On linux the alternative is Gedit and TextEdit on OS X.
